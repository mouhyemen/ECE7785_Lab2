# Lab 2 ECE 7785 - Detect a ball and rotate Turtlebot3

The overall goal of the project is to detect the location of a ball and rotate the Turtlebot3 robot to orient itself and face the ball. From an implementation perspective, this lab deals with Robot Operating System (ROS) and OpenCV (Open-source Computer Vision Library). OpenCV methods are used for detecting the ball and ROS package named "ball_follower_" is created and within the package 2 ROS nodes are implemented - "find_ball.py" and "drive_wheel.py".

## Perception - Ball Detection

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
